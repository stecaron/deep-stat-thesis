This repo regroup all the work related with the thesis I made with regard to my Master Degree at the *Département de mathématiques et de statistique de l'Université Laval* in Quebec City.

# Digital behaviour segmentation with autoencoders

This paper present an application where we want define different groups of users based on their usage of web or application plateforms. To do so, we used a *type* autoencoder that we adapted *in a certain way* and be able to find useful caracteristics that differentiate users in their digital behaviour.

# Academic component

The main academic goal of this paper is to study and compare clustering methods based on neural networks (specifically autoencoders) with well known statistical methods.
